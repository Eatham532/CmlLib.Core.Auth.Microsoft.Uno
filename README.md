## Contains the following packages

- [`CmlLib.Core.Auth.Microsoft.Uno`]

Each project has been migrated to work with the [Uno Platform](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno)

Currently has only been tested on Windows. GTK cannot run the WebView. I plan to create an update to support GTK in the future.
